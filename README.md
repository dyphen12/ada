# Welcome to the ADA Project!

### **ADA v1.3.3**

## _Now in the present!_

## ADA1 Public API.

**Abstract:**
We see patterns in the numbers, these patters are following a context, therefore a syntax but 
this in fact can be very frustrating for things like the nature of the rain, a problem
we treat with RNN LSTM Neural Network for Timeseries forecasting, this model is intended to be a starting point
for a research on LSTM Deep Learning for Forecasting on Stock Market Analysis.


### Deep Learning Stock Market Forecasting System

Insights:

-  Model: ADAcore v1.1b (Already trained.)

- Forecasting functions 1-day to 7-day.

- Share differentiation between forecasts.

- Revenue calculator base on forecast.

- Trend Signal (Buy/Sell)
