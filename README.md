**Abstract:**
We see patterns in the numbers, these patters are following a context, therefore a syntax but 
this in fact can be very frustrating for things like the nature of the rain, a problem
we treat with RNN LSTM Neural Network for Timeseries forecasting, this model is intended to be a starting point
for a research on LSTM Deep Learning for Forecasting on Stock Market Analysis.
